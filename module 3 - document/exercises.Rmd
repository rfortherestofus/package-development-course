## Your Turn 1

1. Open the NAMESPACE file. What do you see?
2. Let's add documentation. Run `use_roxygen_md()`
3. Open `r/themes.R`. Insert a roxygen skeleton for `theme_avalanche()`.
4. Change the title to "AVALANCHE ggplot2 themes"
5. Hit Enter/Return twice after the title.  Make sure the new lines start with `#'`. Add this text: "Minimalistic ggplot themes for use on AVALANCHE reports."
6. run `document()` or press `Ctrl/Cmd + Shift + D`. Read the help page for your function with `?theme_avalanche`.
7. Finally, look at the NAMESPACE file again. What changed?


## Your Turn 2 

Let's keep working on the documentation for `theme_avalanche()`:

1. Remove `@param base_size` and replace it with: @inheritParams ggplot2::theme_minimal
2. For `@param ...`, add: Additional arguments passed to [ggplot2::theme_minimal()]
3. For `@return`, add: a ggplot theme.
4. For `@examples`, add two line breaks (make sure the new lines have roxygen comments!). Add this code:

#' ggplot2::qplot(iris$Sepal.Length) + theme_avalanche()

5. Rebuild the documentation and check the help page for `?theme_avalanche()`.

## Your Turn 3

1. In `R/themes.R`, join the documentation of `theme_avalanche_h()` and `theme_avalanche_v()` to `theme_avalanche()` by replacing the roxygen code for the first two functions with "#' @rdname theme_avalanche". 
2. Make sure both functions still have an export tag, as well!
3. Re-render the documentation and read the help page for `?theme_avalanche_h()`


## Take-aways

* roxygen2 lets you write your documentation in-line with your R code
* `document()` or `Cmd/Ctrl + Shift + D` will build your documentation
* Once you start using `@export`, you start controlling which functions the user sees!
